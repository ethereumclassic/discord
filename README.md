# Discord Community Discussions

Welcome to the `discord` repository! This is a space where members of our Discord community can propose changes, discuss new ideas, and collaborate to improve our Discord server.

## How It Works
- **Propose a Change**: Want to see something new or different on our Discord? Create a new [issue](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/discord/issues) to start the discussion.
- **Participate in Discussions**: Share your thoughts and feedback on existing proposals by commenting on issues.
- **Vote on Ideas**: Use reactions to vote on ideas you support.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep track of what's being discussed and what's decided.

## Guidelines
- Be respectful and constructive in your discussions.
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](link-to-code-of-conduct).
- Check existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Contribution Process
1. **Create an Issue**: Describe your idea or proposal in detail.
2. **Discussion**: The community discusses and refines the idea.
3. **Decision Making**: Maintainers or community leaders will make decisions based on community feedback and practicality.
4. **Implementation**: Approved changes will be implemented in our Discord server.
